# sqlalchemy-challenge
For this assignemnt, I did some some climate analysis on the Honolulu area. First, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to perform a basic analysis and data exploration of the provided database. Below are some graphs to represent the data. Once I completed this initial analysis, I designed a Flask API based on the queries that were delveoped in the first section of the analysis. If you'd like to run this file, the last two routes will provide some summary statistics for the climate history during your requested date range.
